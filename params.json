{"name":"Build your First Angular App","tagline":"","body":"### Welcome to your first Angular app!\r\n\r\nWhat's the single worse feeling in the world? Answer: When disaster strikes, and you need to call a superhero, but you've forgot their phone number. THE WORST FEELING IN THE WORLD.\r\n\r\nThat's why you're going to build: the superhero phone book!\r\n\r\nIn this repository, you're going to find just three files: an index.html, app.js in the js folder, and app.css in the css folder.\r\n\r\nYour job is to build an app that helps you find superheroes's phone numbers. You app will need to display the list of superheroes in app.js, allow you to search that list, and color code the list by whether the superhero is marvel, dc, or independent. You'll also want to add a button next to each superhero to display an image for the superhero.\r\n\r\nTo accomplish your goal, you'll need to:\r\n\r\n1. Bootstrap your angular application. [ngApp Documentation](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/directive/ngApp), [Angular Tutorial - Bootstrapping](https://docs.angularjs.org/tutorial/step_00)\r\n2. Setup a simple module and a controller, attach a controller to your view. [module Documentation](https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/module), [Controller documentation](https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/controller), [Angular Tutorial Step 2](https://docs.angularjs.org/tutorial/step_02)\r\n3. Use your controller to add the list of superheroes to the scope. Use ng-repeat to render the list of superheroes. [NgRepeat documentation](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/directive/ngRepeat), also see step 2 of tutorial above\r\n4. Use ng-model and ng-filter to add a search box to your superhero list. [Step 3 of Angular Tutorial](https://docs.angularjs.org/tutorial/step_03)\r\n5. Use ng-class to add a class to each super hero in the list to color code the list by which comic series the superhero belongs to. The classes are predefined in app.css but feel free to add to them.\r\n6. Add a button next to superhero to display their image at the top of the page. (image URLs are in the list) [Angular Tutorial Step 10](https://docs.angularjs.org/tutorial/step_10), [NgClick Documentation](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/directive/ngClick)\r\n\r\nBonus Challenges (if you finish): \r\n\r\n1. Add a small form to add superheroes to your list.[Form documentation](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/directive/form)\r\n2. Use ngRoute to switch between a detail and a list view. [Angular Tutorial Step 7](https://docs.angularjs.org/tutorial/step_07), [ngRoute documentation](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ngRoute)\r\n3. Use AngularFire to load your superheroes from a remote database. Pre-entered list is hosted at superherophonebook.firebaseapp.com. [AngularFire Documentation](https://www.firebase.com/docs/web/libraries/angular/index.html)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
